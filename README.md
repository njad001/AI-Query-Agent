# Query Agent with LangGraph

This project is a simple query agent built using LangGraph and LangChain.
The agent accepts user questions, routes them through a graph-based workflow, and returns responses using a large language model.

## Tech Stack Used
* Python
* LangGraph
* LangChain
* LLM (Groq / compatible chat model)
* SQL database

## How It Works
* Accepts user questions
* Processes them through an agent graph
* Returns responses asynchronously
* Manages conversation context safely
* The model generates a final response
